# runPhotonBombNextToFirstLayer.mac
#
# This macro launches a photon bomb of 128 nm optical photons from a
# position adjacent to the innermost (PTP) layerâ€”specifically, on the side
# farthest from the reflector.
#
# Geometry assumptions (all positions in mm):
#   Overall container (LAr_main) contains five adjacent layers arranged along the x-axis:
#     PTP:      x from -12.5 to -6.5  (center at -9.5 mm)
#     LAr_gap1: x from -6.5 to -0.5   (center at -3.5 mm)
#     WLS:      x from -0.5 to +5.5   (center at +2.5 mm)
#     LAr_gap2: x from +5.5 to +11.5  (center at +8.5 mm)
#     Reflector: x from +11.5 to +12.5 (center at +12.0 mm)
#
# The photon bomb is generated at x = -13.0 mm (just left of the PTP layer),
# y = 0, z = 0.
#
# All photon energies are in SI units (Joules) and 128 nm corresponds to ~1.55e-18 J.
